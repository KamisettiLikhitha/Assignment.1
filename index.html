    <h1>my favorite place horsleyhills </h1>    
    <p>The native vegetation of the area has been replaced in some parts with dense growths of eucalyptus and plantations of exotic trees. In the past the area had more wildlife including Sambar deer (now reintroduced into the wild), wild boar and sloth bear.[1] More than 133 species of birds have been recorded from the area and these include the endemic Yellow-throated bulbul, first recorded from the area in 1908.[2][3][4] Other birds which are rare in the surrounding region include the black eagle and the white-rumped shama.[5][6] The endemic toad Duttaphrynus hololius[7] has been found here and a ground orchid Diplocentrum recurvum was rediscovered here after nearly a century.[8] Several species of lichen have also been documented from the region.</p>

    <h1>Favorite food vegetable rice</h1>
    <p>The recipe for mix veg rice is very similar to my previous post of vegetable pulao recipe with some subtle changes. basically, the rice is pre-cooked and stir-fried with finely chopped veggies. whereas as in pulao recipes, dry spices and leafy vegetables are grounded to form a fine paste and cooked with raw rice. the flavour and spices are infused to the cooked rice and hence make it aromatic and tasty. but you may not have so much time and luxury to follow this detailed recipe. hence you have this quick and easy instant vegetable rice recipe. perhaps it can also be termed as indian version of the stir-fried recipe with spices and indian vegetables. </p>

    <h1>Favorite Heroine Kajal agarwal</h1>
    <p>Aggarwal had four releases in 2009. She first starred opposite Vinay Rai in the Tamil film Modhi Vilayadu, which garnered mixed reviews and was a financial failure. She then appeared in the high budget Telugu historical drama Magadheera, alongside Ram Charan Teja, which saw her playing double roles for the first time. The film, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, received overwhelming critical acclaim, while Aggarwal, in particular, was praised for her portrayal of a princess. Aggarwal was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress in Telugu and nominated for the award for Best Telugu Actress in the South Scope Awards for her performance.[citation needed] It was highly successful commercially and broke several records,[25] emerging as the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time.[26][27][28] Magadheera's success turned Aggarwal into one of the most sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema.[29] It was released again in Tamil as Maaveeran in 2011, and was also successful at the box office.[30</p>
